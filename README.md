 I focus on utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical modeling, computational geometry, and computer vision algorithms by developing scientific 3D AI-enabled tools to solve complex problems also, I enjoy identifying the root causes of the problems by mathematical modeling and 3D numerical simulations for physics to mimic the physics behind it.
