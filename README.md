### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Hossam Samir from Egypt, I focus on utilizing state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms, software technologies, and machine learning models by developing scientific 3D AI-enabled tools to solve complex problems also, I enjoy identifying the root causes of the problems by mathematical modeling and 3D numerical simulations for physics to mimic the physics behind it.
