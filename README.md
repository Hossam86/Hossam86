### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hossam
#### Software Engineer with a Solid Mathematical and Statistical Background
Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects across various industries, including 3D CAD, Digital Dentistry, and Gaming. Currently, I focus on leveraging advanced mathematical modeling, computational geometry, and computer vision algorithms to develop scientific 3D AI-enabled tools that solve complex problems. I enjoy identifying the root causes of issues through mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, data models, and 3D numerical simulations to understand the underlying processes.

Recently, I've expanded my expertise to include developing 3D web viewers based on WebAssembly technology, enhancing the performance and interactivity of web-based applications.

I have been involved in all phases of the software development life cycle, from requirement gathering and design to coding, testing, and maintenance. My extensive knowledge of object-oriented and data-oriented programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures has enabled me to develop high-quality, efficient, and scalable applications.
